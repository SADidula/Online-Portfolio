                    Overview:
                </span>
                <br>
                This project is a machine learning-based malware and intrusion detection system built using Python for
                the backend ML pipeline and Vue.js for the front-end integration. The core of the system is a hybrid
                CNN-LSTM model, optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to improve classification performance,
                particularly under class imbalance conditions common in intrusion datasets.

                    What I Learned:
                </span>
                <br>
                Through this project, I deepened my understanding of how deep learning architectures like CNN and LSTM
                can be hybridized for structured security data. I learned how to handle class imbalance using Focal Loss
                and how to extend traditional training with metaheuristic optimization (PSO). Additionally, I refined my
                skills in model serialization, inference handling, and designing scalable data pipelines suitable for
                large, noisy datasets in cybersecurity contexts.
