                    What I Learned:
                </span>
                <br>
                This project helped me gain hands-on experience with Googleâ€™s YouTube Data API, working around its
                limitations to stream audio efficiently. I learned how to use Flutterâ€™s media and UI packages to build
                scalable, asynchronous applications with strong performance. It also sharpened my understanding of API
                rate limits, stream buffering, and content retrieval pipelines on mobile platforms.
