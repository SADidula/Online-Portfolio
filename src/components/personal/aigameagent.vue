                    Overview:
                </span>
                <br>
                As my final-year university capstone, I developed an adaptive AI agent for first-person shooter games
                using the Pogamut platform. The goal was to create an agent that could learn and evolve its strategy in
                real-time gameplay using Reinforcement Learning.

                <li>
                    Dynamic Weapon Optimization: Built a real-time feedback system that helps the agent analyze
                    weapon effectiveness and adapt its selection strategy mid-game.

                <li>
                    Enhanced Navigation: Improved pathfinding algorithms allowed the agent to pick the most
                    advantageous items and routes, adjusting to changing in-game conditions.

                    What I Learned:
                </span>
                <br>
                Through this project, I gained hands-on experience applying Reinforcement Learning concepts like
                Q-Learning and SARSA in a real-time gaming context. I learned how to design reward functions and
                decision states to create believable, adaptive AI behavior while balancing performance and realism.
                Working with the Pogamut platform and Unreal Tournament taught me how to integrate complex AI logic into
                existing game engines and troubleshoot challenges in dynamic environments. This project strengthened my
                skills in iterative experimentation, testing, and fine-tuning AI systems â€” and deepened my understanding
                of how machine learning can drive smarter, more engaging gameplay experiences.
